# Daisy

Daisy is an intelligent chat bot that can help users to get food and drink recommendations wherever they are in the world. The bot utilizes Microsoftâ€™s cloud and AI services, including Azure for hosting, Bot Framework as our core platform, and LUIS language understanding for Natural Language Processing.

The bot can be deployed to Facebook Messenger, Slack and has the potential for other channels too so that users can access Daisy on a range of different platforms.
